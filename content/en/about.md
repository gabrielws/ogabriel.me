I'm a technology professional with a degree in Computer Science (2024), currently working as a Junior Systems Analyst at [Z-Act](https://www.z-act.io/). I work across both the analysis and operation of multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) with a focus on cost optimization (FinOps) using tools like Instana and Turbonomic, as well as full-stack system development with technologies such as Java (Quarkus), TypeScript (Nuxt/Vue), PostgreSQL, Kafka, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I have a continuous interest in Artificial Intelligence and regularly follow and study technical papers. Iâ€™m also deeply engaged in open source projects and technical communities focused on innovation and best practices in software development.
